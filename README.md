# LCC Spending Data 

## What is it?

Liverpool City Council report  on, and provide details for, invoices over Â£500 made for the supply of goods and services. 

In [the council's own words](http://liverpool.gov.uk/council/performance-and-spending/budgets-and-finance/transparency-in-local-government/):

	This is so that you know where your money is being spent, and for better scrutiny of spending.


This tool attempts to aggregate and show the data in a more useful format for those that don't like wrangling XLS/CSV files.
